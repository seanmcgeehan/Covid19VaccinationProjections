**General Idea**  - 
This program combines infection estimates with anticipated vaccine distribution rates and use machine learning model to predict heard immunity for the city of Philadelphia. We will be using a database provided by the City of Philadelphia and the project was inspired(and orginally intended to be forked from) Youyang gu. 

This project was bult in January 2021 and utilized only 30 days of Vaccine Data. It was much more optimisitic then other vaccine projections at the time and it's optimisim proved to be fruitful with vaccines rolling out faster then others predicted.
